This assignment is based on the material covered in James et al. We will subsequently open up solutions to the problem sets.

## Exercise 2.1

This question involves the use of multiple linear regression on the `Auto` data set. So load the data set from the `ISLR` package first.

If the following code chunk returns an error, you most likely have to install the `ISLR` package first. Use `install.packages("ISLR")` if this is the case.

```{r}
data("Auto", package = "ISLR")
```


(a) Produce a scatterplot matrix which includes all of the variables in the data set.

```{r}
pairs(Auto)
```

(b) Compute the matrix of correlations between the variables using the function `cor()`. You will need to exclude the `name` variable, which is qualitative.

```{r}
cor(subset(Auto, select=-name))
```

(c) Use the `lm()` function to perform a multiple linear regression with `mpg` as the response and all other variables except `name` as the predictors. Use the `summary()` function to print the results. Comment on the output. For instance:

```{r}
lm.fit = lm(mpg ~.-name, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit)
```

    i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?
    ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?
    iii. What does the coefficient for the `year` variable suggest?  

**i. Is there a relationship between the predictors and the response?** 

Yes. There is a relationship between the predictors and the response. We tested this by fitting a multiple regression model and testing the null hypothesis that:
$$H_0: \beta_{cylinders} = \beta_{displacement} = \beta_{horsepower} 
= \beta_{weight} = \beta_{acceleration} = \beta_{year} = \beta_{origin} = 0$$
The F-statistic returned was very large at 252.4. Furthermore, the p-value associated with the F-statistic was very small. This enables us to reject the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the predictors.  


**ii. Which predictors appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response?**

The predictors `displacement`, `weight`, `year`, and `origin` appear to have a statistically significant relationship to the response at the 99% significance level. 


**iii. What does the coefficient for the `year` variable suggest?**

The coefficient for the `year` variable suggests that as the year increases by 1 year, the miles-per-gallon (MPG) increases by 0.75 units. This means that newer cars have higher MPG and are more fuel efficient. 

(d) Use the `*` and `:` symbols to fit linear regression models with interaction effects. Do any interactions appear to be statistically significant?


I arbitrarily selected the variables to include as interaction terms based on the correlation matrix. Variables that were highly correlated with another variable (e.g. >0.85) were used in the interaction terms. I only included one interaction term in each model at first. In each model, the interaction term was always highly statistically significant (p-value << 0). 

I then tried including two interaction terms in one model and found that while both interaction terms were statistically significant, the `cylinders:displacement` term had a much higher p-value than the `horsepower:weight` term.  

Including as many interaction terms as possible in one model (21 interaction terms) resulted in 6 interaction terms that were statistically significant at the 95% significance level. Although the adjusted R-squared for this model was the highest (where the predictors appeared to explain about 88% of the variation in the response), including so many interaction terms in one model may have led me to over-fit this particular model. 

```{r}
# Including interaction terms
lm.fit1 = lm(mpg ~.-name+cylinders*displacement, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit1)

lm.fit2 = lm(mpg ~.-name+cylinders*weight, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit2)

lm.fit3 = lm(mpg ~.-name+displacement*weight, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit3)

lm.fit4 = lm(mpg ~.-name+displacement*horsepower, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit4)

lm.fit5 = lm(mpg ~.-name+horsepower*cylinders, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit5)

lm.fit6 = lm(mpg ~.-name+weight*horsepower, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit6)
# Interaction terms were highly statistically significant in each model. Overall, including an interaction term also improved the model fit slightly as the adjusted R-squared was slightly higher than in the model without interaction terms. The RSE was also lower in the models with interaction terms. 
```


```{r}
# Including more than one interaction term in a model
lm.fit7 = lm(mpg ~.-name+cylinders*displacement+horsepower*weight, data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit7)
# Interaction terms `cylinders:displacement` and `horsepower:weight` are statistically significant although `horsepower:weight` is highly statistically significant with a much smaller p-value than `cylinders:displacement`. 
```

```{r}
# Including all possible interaction terms in model.
lm.fit8 = lm(mpg~(.-name)*(.-name), data = Auto)
summary(lm.fit8)
# 21 interaction terms were included in this model. Statistically significant terms included: `displacement:weight`, `displacement:year`, `horsepower:acceleration`, `acceleration:year`, `acceleration:origin`, `year:origin`. 
```


## Exercise 2.2

This question should be answered using the `Carseats` dataset from the `ISLR` package. So load the data set from the `ISLR` package first.

```{r}
data("Carseats", package = "ISLR")
```

```{r}
# Inspecting structure of dataset
str(Carseats)

# Summary
summary(Carseats)
```


(a) Fit a multiple regression model to predict `Sales` using `Price`,
`Urban`, and `US`.

```{r}
lm.fitsales = lm(Sales ~ Price + Urban + US, data = Carseats)
summary(lm.fitsales)
```

(b) Provide an interpretation of each coefficient in the model. Be
careful -- some of the variables in the model are qualitative!

* `Price`: The model suggests that there is a negative relationship between `Price` and `Sales`, and that this relationship is highly statistically significant (p-value < 0). As the price increases by 1 unit (e.g. dollar), sales decrease by approximately 0.05 units. 

* `UrbanYes`: The model suggests that there is no significant relationship between `Urban` and `Sales`. Nonetheless, the coefficient suggests that there may be a negative relationship between these variables such that if the individual observation is in an urban area, sales would decrease by approximately 0.02 units. 
* `USYes`: The model suggests that there is a positive relationship between `US` and `Sales`, and that this relationship is highly statistically significant (p-value < 0). If the individual observation is in the US, sales would increase by approximately 1.20 units. 

* Intercept: The coefficient for the intercept is also highly statistically significant (p-value < 0). If the price is 0 units, and the individual observation is not in an urban area and not in the US, sales would increase by approximately 13 units. 


(c) Write out the model in equation form, being careful to handle the qualitative variables properly.


$$Sales = 13.04 - 0.05(Price) - 0.02(UrbanYes) + 1.20(USYes) + \epsilon$$


(d) For which of the predictors can you reject the null hypothesis $H_0 : \beta_j =0$?


I can reject the null hypothesis for `Price` and `USYes` based on their respective p-values, which are very small (p-value << 0). 


(e) On the basis of your response to the previous question, fit a smaller model that only uses the predictors for which there is evidence of association with the outcome.

```{r}
lm.fitsales1 = lm(Sales ~ Price + US, data = Carseats)
summary(lm.fitsales1)
```


(f) How well do the models in (a) and (e) fit the data?

The models do not seem to fit the data very well as the only about one-third of the variation in `Sales` can be explained by the predictors in the models. Specifically, the adjusted R-squared values for models (a) and (e) are 0.2335 and 0.2354 respectively. This means that about 23.35% of the variation in `Sales` can be explained by the variation in the predictors (`Price`, `UrbanYes`, `USYes`) in model (a). While 23.54% of the variation in `Sales` can be explained by the variation in the predictors (`Price`, `USYes`) in model (e).   

In addition, the RSE and F-statistics for models (a) and (e) do not differ much, meaning that neither model (a) nor (e) necessarily perform better than the other. 


(g) Using the model from (e), obtain 95% confidence intervals for the coefficient(s).

```{r}
confint(lm.fitsales1, level = 0.95)
```
